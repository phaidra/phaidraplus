### Upstream configuration for PHP FastCGI (PHP-FPM).

### ***IMPORTANT NOTE:***
### This configuration uses three pools for PHP5-FPM
### named www1, www2 and www3.  It is not necessary 
### that you use this configuration for PHP5-FPM 
### but you **must** make sure that the configuration 
### here matches your PHP5-FPM, either by changing 
### this configuration or your PHP5-FPM configuration.

###_ IMPLEMENT
###_ Mandatory: 1. Review and change as necessary.  

## Add as many servers as needed:
## Cf. http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUpstreamModule.
## Note that this configuration assumes by default that keepalive
## upstream connections are supported and that you have a Nginx
## version with the fair load balancer.

## Add as many servers as needed. Cf. http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUpstreamModule.
upstream phpcgi {
    ## If your version of Nginx doesn't have the fair load balancer:
    ## https://github.com/gnosek/nginx-upstream-fair comment out the
    ## following line.
    #fair;
    server unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
    #127.0.0.1:9000;
    ## Create a backend connection cache. 
    keepalive 5;
}

## Add a third pool as a fallback.
#upstream phpcgi_backup {
#    server unix:/var/run/php5-fpm-www3.sock;
#    ## Create a backend connection cache.
#    keepalive 1;
#}
